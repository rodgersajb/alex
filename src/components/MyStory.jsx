        <p>
          From restaurants to sports broadcasting to writer and blogger, life
          has not been a straight line (in a good way). During covid, I decided
          to dive into tech, beginning with html/css and javascript beginner
          courses and then into Juno Collegeâ€™s web development bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I go to where curiosity takes me. From freelancing, adding to
          my tech stack, to helping friends out with WordPress (after learning
          it, of course). My key take a way from tech is to continuously learn,
          which has always been the plan.
